        <p class="primary-text">
          Located in a fortress built for the surveillance of the Bay of Palma, Cap Rocat posed a great challenge in terms of its restoration, which involved transforming the facilities into a hotel as well as complying with the strict regulations governing a building declared a Heritage Asset and listed as a National Monument. The fortress lies within a Protected Natural Area and blends perfectly into the landscape. Cap Rocat has been completely renovated by Antonio Obrador with the utmost respect for its unique architecture and its natural surroundings. The project has received the Europa Nostra Award, among other accolades.
